        Hogwarts, Tom was sorted into Slytherin House and swiftly became known as an unusually brilliant student. A handsome boy, he was much admired by everyone, with the exception of the Transfiguration professor, Albus Dumbledore. During the holidays, Tom had to return to the Muggle orphanage he despised.

                Secretly, Tom was obsessed with his Slytherin heritage and with finding the ways he might cheat death. He found the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets in his sixth year and released Slytherin’s basilisk within it, killing a student named Myrtle Warren. Slytherin had built the chamber deep in Hogwarts castle and kept it hidden from the other founders. He sealed it so that only his own true heir would be able to unseal the chamber and unleash the horror within to purge the school of “all who were unworthy to study magic.” During this time Tom had begun using a new name among his most intimate friends at Hogwarts. Contemptuous of the name of his “foul, common Muggle” father, he made an anagram of Tom Marvolo Riddle. The rearranged letters spelled “I AM LORD VOLDEMORT.” It was a name he hoped “wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak,” when he became the “greatest sorcerer in the world.” (CS17).

                On June 13, 1943, Tom staged the capture of another student, Rubeus Hagrid, and tricked Headmaster Armando Dippet into believing Hagrid and his giant spider Aragog were responsible for the attacks. Tom received an engraved trophy for special services to the school, but he realized that Albus Dumbledore was keeping an “annoyingly close watch” on him and it was not safe to open the Chamber of Secrets again while he was still at school. Tom preserved himself in the pages of a diary with the hope that he would one day be able to lead another in his footsteps and “finish Salazar Slytherin’s noble work.”.

                Now lets know about The different houses of the Hogwarts.

                <p> "The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your House points, while any rule breaking will lose House points. At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House Cup, a great honour. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House becomes yours."
                    <br></br>Gryffindor
                    <br></br> Gryffindor
                    Gryffindor Crest-0.jpg
                    Gryffindor values bravery, daring, nerve, and chivalry.[4] Its emblematic animal is the lion,[3] and its colours are scarlet and gold.[2] Minerva McGonagall was the most recent Head of Gryffindor.[5] Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, also known as "Nearly Headless Nick", was the House Ghost. The founder of the House was Godric Gryffindor. Gryffindor corresponds to the element of Fire. The common room was located in one of the highest towers at Hogwarts, the entrance was situated on the seventh floor in the east wing of the castle and is guarded by a portrait of The Fat Lady. She permits entrance if given the correct password, which is changed numerous times throughout the school year.[4] Famous Gryffindors include Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter,[4] and Minerva McGonagall.
                    <br></br>
                    Slytherin<br></br>
                    Slytherin House values ambition, leadership, self-preservation, cunning and resourcefulness[4] and was founded by Salazar Slytherin.[1] Its emblematic animal is the serpent,[3] and its colours are emerald green and silver.[2] Professor Horace Slughorn was the Head of Slytherin during the 1997–1998 school year, replacing Severus Snape, who as well, replaced Slughorn as Potions Professor when he retired for the first time several years prior.[8][7] Slytherin had produced the most Death Eaters and Dark Wizards,[23][31][32] including Tom Riddle,[26] Bellatrix Lestrange and Lucius Malfoy, for example. But that does not mean that other Houses haven’t produced any; Peter Pettigrew was a Gryffindor, and Quirinus Quirrell was a Ravenclaw.

                    The Bloody Baron is the House Ghost. The founder of the House was Salazar Slytherin. Slytherin corresponds roughly to the element of water. The Slytherin dormitories and common room are reached through a bare stone wall in the Dungeons. The Slytherin common room lies beneath the Black Lake. It is a long, low underground room with rough stone walls and silver lamps hanging from the ceiling.[10] Famous Slytherins include Merlin, Tom Riddle, Draco Malfoy, and Dolores Umbridge.
                    <br></br> Hufflepuff<br></br>
                    Hufflepuff values hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play. Its emblematic animal is the badger, and yellow and black are its colours. Pomona Sprout was the Head of Hufflepuff during 1991-1998, Sprout left the post of Head of Hufflepuff and Herbology Professor sometime before 2017 and her successor for the position of Head of Hufflepuff is currently unknown. The Fat Friar is its ghost.[4] The founder of the House was Helga Hufflepuff.

                    Hufflepuff corresponds to the element of earth. The Hufflepuff dormitories and common room are located somewhere in the basement, near the castle's kitchens. It can be accessed by tapping the barrel two from the bottom, middle of the second row in the rhythm of "Helga Hufflepuff" and is described as being a cosy and welcoming place with yellow hangings, fat armchairs, and underground tunnels that lead to the dormitories, which have perfectly round doors, similar to barrel tops. Famous Hufflepuffs include Hengist of Woodcroft (founder of Hogsmeade), Newt Scamander (author of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them), and Artemisia Lufkin (first female minister for magic).
                    <br></br> Ravenclaw
                    <br></br>Ravenclaw values intelligence, knowledge, curiosity, creativity and wit.[4] Its emblematic animal is the eagle,[3] and its colours are blue and bronze. The Ravenclaw Head of House in the 1990s was Filius Flitwick. The ghost of Ravenclaw is the Grey Lady,who was the daughter of Rowena Ravenclaw, the House's founder.[30] Ravenclaw corresponds to the element of air. The Ravenclaw common room and dormitories are located in a tower on the west side of the castle. Ravenclaw students must answer a riddle as opposed to giving a password to enter their dormitories. This riddle, however, can be answered by non-Ravenclaws. Famous Ravenclaws include Luna Lovegood, Gilderoy Lockhart, Ignatia Wildsmith (inventor of Floo powder), and Garrick Ollivander
